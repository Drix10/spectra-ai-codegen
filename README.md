# 📋 Description

### What is CosLynx.com?

**CosLynx** is an AI-powered MVP generator that creates custom Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) based on provided project details. The AI first determines the project's features, then selects the appropriate tech stack, designs the codebase structure, generates the corresponding code, builds it, tests it, and finally pushes it to GitHub. This comprehensive process culminates in the automatic creation of a functional, tested MVP ready for deployment.

### What problem are we trying to solve?

We're addressing the challenge of rapidly developing and deploying MVPs using natural language inputs. Our goal is to streamline the entire MVP creation process, from concept to deployment, enabling users to bring their ideas to life efficiently. This approach significantly reduces development time by providing a robust, tested foundation that users can build upon seamlessly.

## 📑 Key Features:
- 🎨 **Custom MVP Design**: Tailors the MVP to your specific requirements.
- 📁 **Project Structure**: Constructs a scalable and maintainable architecture.
- 💻 **Code Generation**: Produces high-quality, bug-free code based on user input.
- 🧪 **Automated Testing**: Ensures reliability and functionality of the generated MVP.
- 🚀 **GitHub Integration**: Automatically pushes the completed MVP to GitHub.
